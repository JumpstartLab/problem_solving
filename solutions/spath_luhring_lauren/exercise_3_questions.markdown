i thought this was going to be "easy" because i could use squeeze again, but that is apparently not how squeeze works.

here is what i would do:

- count the number of occurrences for each letter in the string
- return the string less any letters that occur > 1 time


this exercise makes me realize that my "finished" exercise one really doesn't do the trick because squeeze won't work if there is a break in the string like "hello yellow".
