lauren exercise 2 questions

1.  for this exercise the instructions do not say that you can't use additional data structures (arrays).  so i think i need to use an array.

2.  first i'm going to make sure i can do it using .reverse and then go from there.

3.  trying different methods like "shuffle" and "shift" but none seem to do what i want.  that is because reverse does what i want...

4.  ok, so what if i put all of the letters into a hash and give the first letter the key 1, second letter key 2, etc. and then sorted by the keys highest to lowest or something like that?
