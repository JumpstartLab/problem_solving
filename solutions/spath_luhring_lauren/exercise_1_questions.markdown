1.  how the hell am i going to do this without using '.uniq' or '.reverse?'

2.  wait, now i can't even break this into an array?

3.  i am using ruby methods like "length" and "squeeze", but i don't think i'm doing it right because i am having to define them in my solution.  aren't these built in?  how come my test doesn't just know that ".length" wants me to return the length of the string?

4.  i think i kind of just answered this/figured it out.  it's because in my test i am just making up method names.  it's in the solution where i am using the Ruby methods to do work.  right?  are you enjoying this stream of consciousness?  

5.  also, Katrina just taught me about "squeeze" the other day and i am quite enjoying it :)

6.  i think i am finished with this, but i am not sure if it is correct to use an "if" statement in my final test assertion.

did i actually do this correctly?  i don't think i used additional data structures...did i?  the main problem i see with these tests is that if you change the string from "hello" to "cat", for example, the tests with the hard coded assertions for letter counts fail.  but this is fine, right?  the logic works, it's just that i'm using it on a particular string with a particular number of letters.
