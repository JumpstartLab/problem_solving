#### Problem 2: Write code to reverse a string without using `.reverse`

* Is there a method to determine the median index of an array
* What's to do the equivalent of the JavaScript for loop in Ruby?
* How do I simultaneously reassign two variables to each other without reassigning one first and losing the value of the first variable?
* What does pop return? 
* Does pop change the value of the array or just return the last item in the array?
