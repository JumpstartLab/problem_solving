* What does the matrix look like?
* What data structures can we use to represent the matrix?
* How can we find the array that holds the zero?
* How can we find the index of the zero?
* How do we save that index and array to be used later?
* How can we use that index value to modify the existing elements in the other arrays with that same index value?
* At what point do we change the values in the first array to zero?
* Are we changing the structure of the matrix at all so we have to rebuild it?
* Why does the each in the row change method return the matrix changed instead of the original matrix, while the collect in the column change method requires a collect?
* How come if I split line 23 into its own method its not recognized within the changed matrix method?
