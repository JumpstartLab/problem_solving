####Problem 1: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters without using `uniq`. What if you can not use additional data structures?

* If I call .split on a string will it split on the letter or do I have to call .split("")?
* Does contain?(x) work the same as include?(x)?
* Should I make my methods class methods?
* Should I include a positive and negative test case for the unique? method in the same test or in separate tests?
