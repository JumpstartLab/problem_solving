## Problem 1

* How can I loop through the characters in a string without turning it into an array first?
* How can I check if a given character is in this string?

## Problem 2

* Can I reuse the loop from Problem 1 to solve this problem?
* What do I need to do to avoid off-by-one errors here?

## Problem 3

* How is this different from Problem 1?
* Can I reuse any code from that solution in this one?

## Problem 4

* What is the definition of an anagram?
* Should I check if the strings are of the same length before operating on them?
* Do I need to sort these to check if all their letters are the same?
* If so, what sorting algorithm should I use.
* If not, how can I solve this more simply?

## Problem 5

* How can I put three characters where there was only one before?
* If I'm looping with an index and accessing `i+1`, how can I prevent the method from blowing up?

## Problem 6

* Do I need to use push and pop / shift and unshift?
* What's the difference between an even instance of *n* and an odd one? Especially regarding what the middle of the matrix looks like?
* Can I use columns? How would I calculate them?
* Should I implement both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations? How would they differ?
* How will I check if the matrix is square?

## Problem 7

* What's the easiest way to zero out the columns?
* Do I need to worry about whether to use a string or integer to represent the "0"s?

## Problem 8

* What's the easiest way to move all the letters over by one?
