## Strings

1. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters without using `uniq`. What if you can not use additional data structures?

2. Write code to reverse a string without using `.reverse`

3. Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using `.uniq`

4. Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not

5. Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with ‘%20’ without `.gsub` or `.sub`

6. Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees.

7. Write an algorithm such that if any single element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column is set to 0

8. Assume you have a method `is_substring` which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, `s1` and `s2`, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to `is_substring` (ie: “waterbottle” is a rotation of “erbottlewat”)
