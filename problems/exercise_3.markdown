## Binary Numbers

1. Why are binary numbers used in Computer Science?
2. Write an algorithm for counting up in binary
3. What are the binary equivalents for the decimal numbers 28 through 34?
4. Write a pseudocode algorithm for converting a binary number to decimal
5. What's the sum of the binary numbers 1001 and 1011? Can you find it through two totally different processes?
6. Write a pseudocode algorithm for converting a decimal number to binary
7. If one binary digit is a bit and a byte is eight bits, what's the largest decimal number you can represent with eight bytes?
8. In some systems, a 1 in the most significant / leftmost bit means that the number is negative, so "1011" would equate to -3 in decimal. What would the result be in such a system of "1001" minus "0011"?
